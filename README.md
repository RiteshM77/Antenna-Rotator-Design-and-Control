Project Title: **Antenna Rotator Design and Control with Arduino Mega 2560**

**Project Description:**

**Overview:**
The "Antenna Rotator Design and Control" project aims to create an automated system for precisely controlling the orientation of an antenna. By using an Arduino Mega 2560 and a variety of components such as a servo motor, toggle switch, push buttons, potentiometer, LCD display, and RF433 MHz transmitter and receiver modules, this project offers a versatile and user-friendly solution for antenna positioning.

**Features:**

1. **Servo Motor Control:** The core of this project is the servo motor, which is responsible for rotating the antenna. The Arduino Mega 2560, in conjunction with the servo motor, allows for precise control of the antenna's azimuth and elevation angles.

2. **User Interface:** The system features an intuitive user interface using the following components:
   - **Toggle Switch:** To toggle between azimuth and elevation control modes.
   - **Push Buttons:** For fine-grained adjustment of antenna angles in both modes.
   - **Potentiometer (10k ohm):** Provides a smooth and continuous way to adjust antenna angles.
   - **LCD Display:** Displays the current antenna position and mode, ensuring user awareness and control.

3. **Wireless Control:** The RF433 MHz transmitter and receiver modules enable wireless control of the antenna rotator, offering flexibility in positioning the antenna from a distance.

4. **Feedback and Precision:** The LCD display provides real-time feedback on the antenna's position, enhancing precision and user confidence in the system.

**Applications:**
- Ham radio enthusiasts can use this system to precisely point their antennas towards specific satellites or radio stations.
- It can be employed in tracking systems for scientific and communication satellites.
- Radio astronomy enthusiasts can use it for tracking celestial objects.

**Benefits:**
- Simplified and precise antenna control.
- User-friendly interface with both manual and wireless control options.
- Real-time feedback for enhanced accuracy.
- Versatile applications in various fields.
